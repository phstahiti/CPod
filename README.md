## Install

Get the [**latest releases**](https://github.com/z-------------/CPod/releases).

Available for **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux**.

### Install for development

0. Have [Node.js 8](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install), and [gulp-cli](https://gulpjs.com/) installed, and `cd` to the repo directory.
1. Run `yarn` to install npm dependencies.
2. Run `gulp` to compile and concatenate JavaScript, SCSS, Pug, etc. (or `gulp both` to also watch for changes).
3. Run `yarn start` to start CPod.

Be sure not to work on `all.js` or on any of the compiled `.html` or `.css` files when there is a `.pug` or `.scss` counterpart, respectively.

### Packaging

0. Follow steps 0 to 2 in [Install for development](#install-for-development)
1. (If electron-builder complains about missing dependencies) Set temporary environment variable: `ELECTRON_BUILDER_ALLOW_UNRESOLVED_DEPENDENCIES=true`
2. Run `yarn dist`

The binary/installer will be in the `dist` directory.
